											<strong>Abstract: </strong>
											Recent developments in machine learning has transformed many dataanalytic applications, such as speech recognition, computer vision, and naturallanguage processing. ML also made its impact to the security and privacycommunity, for instance, in network intrusion detection, malware detection, andmalicious behavior analysis. Meanwhile, a broad spectrum of cyber-attacksagainst machine learning systems has been proposed. Such attacks aim to breakthe integrity or confidentiality of the models. In this talk, I will introduce severalresearch projects from KU’s InfoSec group on adversarial/trustworthy machinelearning. Through this talk, we hope to highlight the security and privacy issuesin AI/ML systems, which may be helpful for the audience to identify theopportunities and challenges in their own research fields.

											<strong>Abstract: </strong>
											拆分学习和拆分推理通过将深度学习模型划分为不同参与方之间的连续模型参数层，实现分布式训练和预测。在协议中，通常包括一组客户端和一个服务器。客户端旨在通过安全地组合他们私有的数据集来训练共享的深度学习模型；服务器管理这个过程并承担大部分所需的计算成本。当模型训练完毕后，不同参与方基于该模型执行分布式模型预测任务。拆分学习和拆分推理作为一类新兴的协作式机器学习范式，能够更好地权衡客户端设备的计算负担和敏感数据的隐私泄露风险。然而，现有研究表明，仅依赖客户端上传的模型中间层输出特征，恶意的服务器仍可以发起成员推理、属性推理、数据重构等攻击，这对客户端的私有数据造成了严重的隐私威胁。由此催生了一系列防御机制，通过对中间层输出特征进行混淆，提供了模型效用性和数据隐私性的权衡。

											Program Modularization

										<td colspan="2" class="_abstract">
											<strong>Abstract: </strong>
											Today's software programs are bloating and have become extremely complex. As there is typically no internal isolation among modules in a program, a vulnerability can be exploited to corrupt the memory and take control of the whole program. Program modularization is thus a promising security mechanism that splits a complex program into smaller modules, so that memory-access instructions can be
constrained from corrupting irrelevant modules. However, existing approaches use data-flow analysis to determine dependences, which is impractical.  In this talk, I will share novel and practical techniques for program modularization, including type-based dependence analysis and the enforcement of least-permission memory regions. These techniques can be applied to both large programs and small devices with limited hardware support.

												<td colspan="2" class="_abstract">
													<strong>Abstract: </strong>
													Classic system programming languages, such as C and C++, are designed with efficiency as their top priority. This leads to reduced security guarantees (e.g., no memory safety) and raises broad concerns. In the first part, I will present our efforts toward a better efficiency-security balance of C by introducing highly optimized sanitization to eliminate memory safety issues.
		More recently, Rust emerged and is believed to be a game changer for systems programming. Rust comes with enforcement of various security properties (memory safe, type safe, and thread safe) and claims to be C-level fast. In the second part, I will present our study of understanding the efficiency of Rust, considering C as the baseline.
		A good efficiency-security balance is certainly nice to have, but is it possible to achieve perfection in both aspects of modern system programming languages? In the last part, I'll talk about our ongoing effort to explore that question.

													Achieving Efficient and Privacy-Preserving (α,β)-Core Query over Bipartite Graphs in Cloud

												<td colspan="2" class="_abstract">
													<strong>Abstract: </strong>
													Bipartite graphs have been widely adopted in applications such as e-healthcare and recommendation systems thanks to their ability to model various real-world relationships. Meanwhile, (α, β)-core query services over bipartite graphs are generally recognized as a promising approach for finding communities, i.e., sets of closely related vertices, in a bipartite graph. As the bipartite graph grows, the service providers tend to outsource the services to the cloud for flexible and highly reliable computational resources. However, since the cloud is not fully trustable, there are privacy concerns related to the dataset, query requests, and results. Although many schemes have been proposed for privacy-preserving queries over graphs, they cannot be directly adopted to handle accurate (α, β)-core queries over bipartite graphs. Aiming at the challenges, under the two-server setting, this paper constructs two privacy-preserving schemes with different levels of security to handle (α, β)-core queries over the bipartite graph. Specifically, in the proposed schemes, a graph is represented as an index containing an edge table and a node table and further encrypted by a symmetric homomorphic encryption scheme, and then the two servers securely traverse the index. Detailed security analysis shows that both schemes can achieve access pattern privacy, while the security-enhanced one can further protect the structure privacy of the query requests and results. In addition, extensive performance evaluations are conducted, and the results also indicate our proposed schemes are computationally efficient.
